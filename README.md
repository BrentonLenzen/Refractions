# Refractions
This is a sample of the code for "REFRACTIONS: Bullets, Rainbows and Moonlight", a bullet-hell game that was created for a game jam in Fall of 2019. I was not the only programmer working on this project, so this sample only contains the code I directly worked on. 

I was primarily responsible for coding boss AI behavior, bullet physics, and the overall game system.
